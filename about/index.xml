      <description>Hello everyone,
My name is Spyros Chiotakis, and like you, I’m just a regular person trying to find my path through life. I studied Computer Engineering in Greece at the Hellenic Mediterranean University at Heraklion, Crete. Then I received my masters at the University of York in Digital Systems Engineering at the United Kingdom. Currently working in France at GreenWaves Technologies as a microelectronics engineer.
The blog’s purpose is to educate on topics such as, digital design, computer architecture, HDL languages (VHDL/Verilog), and if time allows, I will try to explain a few things about OS and compilers in correlation with computer architecture.</description>
