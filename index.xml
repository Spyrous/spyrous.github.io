      <description>Introduction In this tutorial we will design a simple adder IP and use Xilinx Vivado AXI wrapper generator to allow our ARM cores to read/write to our IP through the AXI interface.
The high-level design will be the one in the image below. We will have 2 IPs. One is our custom made IP wrapped with AXI interface and an AXI BRAM controller just for demonstration purposes.
Tools Used The following tools where used to create this tutorial:</description>

      <description>Hello everyone,
My name is Spyros Chiotakis, and like you, I’m just a regular person trying to find my path through life. I studied Computer Engineering in Greece at the Hellenic Mediterranean University at Heraklion, Crete. Then I received my masters at the University of York in Digital Systems Engineering at the United Kingdom. Currently working in France at GreenWaves Technologies as a microelectronics engineer.
The blog’s purpose is to educate on topics such as, digital design, computer architecture, HDL languages (VHDL/Verilog), and if time allows, I will try to explain a few things about OS and compilers in correlation with computer architecture.</description>
